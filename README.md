# Crash City
  This interactive web application provides a clear, visual understanding of traffic collisions and their impacts across Philadelphia. As a user, you are presented with a map of the city that is intuitively overlaid with data points representing individual crashes. You can immediately see patterns and hotspots of high accident frequency. By simply hovering your cursor over any cluster or individual point on the map, a detailed tooltip instantly appears, revealing key information about that location, such as the total number of accidents, how many resulted in fatalities or serious injuries, the most common time of day for incidents, and seasonal trends.
